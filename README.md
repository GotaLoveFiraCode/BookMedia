## The website

When you go to our **website** (presuming you already have an **account**) you will land on the **Homepage**. Here you can **access** all of your saved **Reads**, **Clubs**, and **Contacts**. If you don't want to *keep reading something*, or *message some friends*, you can select one of possible **tabs** at the edge of the screen. These will include **Account**, **Clubs**, **People**, **Reads**, **Settings**, and **Custom**.

## Accounts

**Anyone** can create there own accounts, though this is not strictly necessary if you just want to read **book reviews** or **Clubs** all day. An account is free to create, and is stored in our **military grade** secure *AES-256* bit **encrypted servers**. We do **not track** you with out your full consent, if you don't mind **helping us out**, you can *opt-in* and see up to **40% less ads**! An account lets you save **Clubs**, and **Contacts**, it also gives you one **free** read every month. This means that you can a read a **new book** and **talk about it** all you want every month. Accounts are what let you use **BookMedia** to its *fullest*.

## Chats

If you posses an **account**, you can talk to whom ever you want--if its the *prince of the moon*, as long as they have an account, you can. Just type in there **messaging ID** (the equivalent to a *user name* **shorthand**, e.g. if you are called *FoxyBottle*, your **ID** might be *fxyBOT*, these are randomly generated), and tell them what you want. *Messaging IDs* are highly **flexible**, and if you have *Premium* you can even choose your own *MID* out of **five options**. *MIDs* are **unique**, even if your **user name** isn't. *Chat'ing* is possible in *markdown*, or with our UI **editor**. **Chats** are *essential* for communicating with your friends over **BookMedia**.
